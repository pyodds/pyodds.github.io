PyODDS
====================================

**PyODDS** is an end-to end **Python** system for **outlier** **detection** with **database** **support**. PyODDS provides outlier detection algorithms which meet the demands for users in different fields, w/wo data science or machine learning background. PyODDS gives the ability to execute machine learning algorithms in-database without moving data out of the database server or over the network. It also provides access to a wide range of outlier detection algorithms, including statistical analysis and more recent deep learning based approaches.

PyODDS is featured for:

-  **Full Stack Service** which supports operations and maintenances
   from light-weight SQL based database to back-end machine learning
   algorithms and makes the throughput speed faster;

-  **State-of-the-art Anomaly Detection Approaches** including
   **Statistical/Machine Learning/Deep Learning** models with unified
   APIs and detailed documentation;

-  **Powerful Data Analysis Mechanism** which supports both **static and
   time-series data** analysis with flexible time-slice(sliding-window)
   segmentation.
